    " \n",
    "The basic rules are outlined below and a several common betting options are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Come-Out Roll\n",
    " - The game begins with the shooter making a \"come-out\" roll using two six-sided dice.\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is a **7 or 11**, the pass line bet wins (called a \"natural\").\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is **2, 3, or 12**, the pass line bet loses (called \"craps\").\n",
    " - If the come-out roll is **4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10**, that number becomes the **point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Point Phase\n",
    " - Once the point is established, the shooter continues rolling.\n",
    " - The goal is to roll the **point number again before rolling a 7**.\n",
    "     - If the shooter rolls the point again, pass line bets win.\n",
    "     - If the shooter rolls a **7 before the point**, pass line bets lose (called \"seven out\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Some Betting Options\n",
    " - **Pass Line Bet**: Wins on a natural (7 or 11), loses on craps (2, 3, 12), wins if point is hit before a 7.\n",
    " - **Don't Pass Bet**: Opposite of pass line. Wins on craps (2, 3), ties on 12, loses on 7 or 11.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### Part 1\n",
    " Determine the odds of winning at craps for the Pass Line Bet and Don't Pass Bet.\n",

The decision of which strategy to follow at a given time can be based on adaptive rules informed by past performance, similar in spirit to the strategies explored here."
